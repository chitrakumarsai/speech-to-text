    Audio Preprocessing Module

    This module is intended for audio preprocessing tasks. Students are encouraged to
    write their audio preprocessing code within this file. If audio preprocessing is
    not part of your project, feel free to remove this file.

    Usage:
    1. Write your audio preprocessing code within the designated functions or classes.
    2. If you do not require audio preprocessing, you can safely remove this file from your project.

    Example:
        # Example audio preprocessing code
        def preprocess_audio(audio_data):
            # Your audio preprocessing code here
            pass

        # Call your preprocessing function
        processed_audio = preprocess_audio(raw_audio_data)

    Note:
        - Ensure that your audio preprocessing code is modular and can be easily integrated
          into other parts of your project.
        - Make sure to import and utilize any necessary libraries for audio processing.

    For any questions or clarifications, please refer to the project documentation or
    consult with your instructor.
