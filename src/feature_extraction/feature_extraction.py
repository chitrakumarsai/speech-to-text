    Audio Feature Engineering Module

    This module is dedicated to feature engineering for audio data, particularly for use in
    machine learning tasks. Students are encouraged to implement their feature engineering
    code within this file. If feature engineering is not relevant to your project, you can
    safely remove this file.

    Usage:
    1. Develop your feature engineering techniques within the designated functions or classes
       in this file.
    2. If feature engineering is not a requirement for your project, feel free to remove this file.

    Example:
        # Example feature engineering code
        def extract_mfcc_features(audio_data):
            # Your feature extraction logic here (e.g., Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
            pass

        # Apply feature extraction to raw audio data
        audio_features = extract_mfcc_features(raw_audio_data)

    Note:
        - Ensure that your feature engineering code generates meaningful and informative
          features for the machine learning task at hand.
        - Utilize relevant audio processing libraries or tools to implement your feature
          engineering techniques.
        - If you have any questions or encounter challenges, refer to the project documentation
          or consult with your instructor.

    For any further assistance or clarifications, feel free to reach out to your instructor or
    refer to the project documentation.
