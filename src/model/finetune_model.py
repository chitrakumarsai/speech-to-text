    Fine-tuning Module for ASR Models

    This module is dedicated to fine-tuning Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. Students
    are encouraged to implement their fine-tuning code within this file. If fine-tuning is not
    applicable to your project, you can safely remove this file.

    Usage:
    1. Develop your fine-tuning code for ASR models within the designated functions or classes
       in this file.
    2. If fine-tuning is not a requirement for your project, feel free to remove this file.

    Example:
        # Example fine-tuning code
        def fine_tune_asr_model(pretrained_model, training_data):
            # Your fine-tuning logic here
            pass

        # Load a pre-trained ASR model
        pre_trained_model = load_pretrained_asr_model('pretrained_model.pth')

        # Fine-tune the model on training data
        fine_tuned_model = fine_tune_asr_model(pre_trained_model, training_data)

    Refer to the 'whisper_finetuning.ipynb' notebook in the 'notebooks' folder for a detailed
    guide and examples on how to fine-tune ASR models using the Whisper ASR framework.

    Note:
        - Ensure that your fine-tuning code is well-structured and adheres to best practices
          for ASR model fine-tuning.
        - Make use of relevant ASR libraries or frameworks to facilitate the fine-tuning process.
        - For additional guidance, refer to the 'whisper_finetuning.ipynb' notebook in the
          'notebooks' folder. Please note that this notebook is in Google Colab format (".ipynb").

    For any further assistance or clarifications, feel free to reach out to your instructor or
    refer to the project documentation.
