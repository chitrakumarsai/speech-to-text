    ASR Model Evaluation Module

    This module is designed for evaluating a fine-tuned Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model.
    Students are encouraged to write their code for model evaluation within this file. If model
    evaluation is not applicable to your project, you can safely remove this file.

    Usage:
    1. Implement your evaluation logic for the fine-tuned ASR model in the designated functions
       or classes within this file.
    2. If model evaluation is not a requirement for your project, feel free to remove this file.

    Example:
        # Example ASR model evaluation code
        def evaluate_asr_model(model, test_data):
            # Your ASR model evaluation logic here
            pass

        # Load your fine-tuned ASR model
        fine_tuned_model = load_asr_model('fine_tuned_model.pth')

        # Evaluate the model on test data
        evaluation_results = evaluate_asr_model(fine_tuned_model, test_data)

    Note:
        - Ensure that your evaluation code is well-structured, providing meaningful metrics
          and insights into the performance of the fine-tuned ASR model.
        - Import and utilize any necessary libraries or tools for ASR model evaluation.
        - If you encounter any challenges or have questions, refer to the project documentation
          or consult with your instructor.

    For any further assistance or clarifications, feel free to reach out to your instructor or
    refer to the project documentation.
